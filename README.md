### About Me

Hello, I’m [@engrtitooo](https://github.com/engrtitooo). I’m the founder of **SpinFund**, a fintech platform focused on cooperative savings and Sharia-compliant lending, designed to empower underserved and immigrant communities in the U.S. and beyond.

With over 18 years of experience in mechanical engineering and project management, I currently serve as a **Senior Mechanical Engineer at Metra**, Chicago’s commuter rail system, where I manage complex infrastructure upgrades across HVAC and MEP systems.

I bring engineering precision and systems thinking into the fintech space—building ethical, AI-driven financial tools that promote transparency, trust, and financial well-being.
